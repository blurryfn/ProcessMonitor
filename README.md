# ProcessMonitor
A experimental process monitoring tool I built out of curiosity. Feel free to explore or modify it!

# Features
Process Monitoring: Basic functionality to monitor system processes.

# Quick Fixes
CPR is hardcoded:
The CPR is hardcoded. If you want to customize it, you will need to fix a few lines in the code (I will fix this later).

Fixing libcurl.lib error
To resolve errors with the libcurl.lib file:

Open ProcessMonitor.vcxproj in notepad or visual studio code and
Locate the path for libcurl.lib.

Update it to the correct file path on your system.


# Why I Made This
Honestly, I was bored and wanted to make something. This project doesn't have a particular use case, but it might be a fun for you to mess around with if you're into experimenting with system tools.
